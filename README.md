# Class_Programs

This is a repository of all my programs in which I have programmed in my short time of programming.

This repository is meant for the propgrams in which I create during my time taking several Udemy courses.
These programs may consist of Android Applications, Java files, or Phython scripts in which I have created using the classes I am taking.

I hope you get a good look at what I am interested in by looking at this Github Repository.

Thanks,
Kyle Gause
